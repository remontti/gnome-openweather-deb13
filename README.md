OpenWeather Remontti is a simple extension for displaying weather conditions and
forecasts for any location on Earth in the GNOME Shell.

The extension is very configurable and does not use GNOME Weather.

Weather data is fetched from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org)
including 3 hour forecasts for up to 5 days.

## Contributing

Everyone is welcome to contribute! You can contribute code, or translations
via pull requests.

Run `make help` for help on make targets and scripts useful for testing.

### Translating

Translations are super helpful because once I forked
this extension I have made a lot of UI additions, and I only speak English!

Translations can be made by editing the language's file `./po/*.po`.
Edit the `msgstr` field to the translation for the English in `msgid`.

Run the following commands:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/penguin-teal/gnome-openweather.git

cd gnome-openweather

# This switches to the latest stable release
git switch --detach latest

make && make install
```
